Assignment #2: Simple Math Operations:
Objective: Create a program that performs simple math operations on two numbers.
Requirements: The program should add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers and print the results. Use
variables to store the numbers and results. 

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

addition_result = number1 + number2
subtraction_result = number1 - number2
multiplication_result = number1 * number2
division_result = number1 / number2

print("Addition:", addition_result)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction_result)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication_result)
print("Division:", division_result) 
output: Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0


Assignment #3: Area of a Circle:
Objective: Write a program that calculates the area of a circle.
Requirements: The program should ask the user to input the radius of the circle and then calculate and display
the area. Use the formula area = math.pi * radius **2. 

import math
radius = 7 
area = math.pi * radius * radius 
print('The area of the circle is', area) 
output: The area of the circle is 153.93804002589985 


Assignment #4: Convert Minutes to Seconds:
Objective: Develop a program that converts minutes into seconds.
Requirements: The program should take a number of minutes as input and output the equivalent number of seconds. 

minutes = 3
seconds = minutes * 60
print('3 minutes equals to', seconds, 'seconds') 
output: 3 minutes equals to 180 seconds 


Assignment #5: Print IP addresses:
Objective: given the network with the following pattern: 192.168.0.3/24.
Pring all the IP addresses within this network. 

import ipaddress
network_address = "192.168.0.0/30"
network = ipaddress.IPv4Network(network_address)
print('All IP addresses within the network')
for ip_address in network:
    print(ip_address) 
output: All IP addresses within the network:
192.168.0.0
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2
192.168.0.3
